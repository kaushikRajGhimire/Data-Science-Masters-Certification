        "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It also provides access control through access modifiers (e.g., private, protected, public).\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities to the users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: The mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: The ability of a single function, method, or operator to behave differently based on the input or object. It can be achieved via method overriding and overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
        "__init__() is a special method in Python known as the constructor. It is automatically called when an object is created from a class, and it allows the class to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

        "In this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "__init__() initializes the name and age attributes for each object created from the Person class.\n",
        "When person1 is created, __init__() automatically sets the values for name and age.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Q4. Why is self used in OOPs?\n",
        "self refers to the instance of the class. It allows the object to access its own attributes and methods. It must be the first parameter of any method in a class, though it does not need to be passed explicitly when the method is calledâ€”it is automatically passed by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "self is used to differentiate between instance variables (attributes) and local variables inside methods.\n",
